### 02. PBS-GenericPlaybook

**Required Assets: Any**

```
This playbook shows how we can collect indicators in a more generic way. As long as the container artifacts use CEF Compatible fields to store indicators , this playbook will collect IPs, Domains, URLs and Hashes. 

It will then run related actions on any asset which supports such actions. 
```
